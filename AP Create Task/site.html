        <h3>Why Make a Website for <em>Freestyle</em> Schedules?</h3>
        <p>Most figure skaters skate at multiple rinks, and they need to know when they can skate. Accessing these schedules takes time due to website complexity of each rink, so having one place to find all of the information a skater needs is essential! Currently, this site focuses on 4 rinks: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Aspen Ice, located in Randolph, NJ</li>
            <li>Richard J Codey Arena, located in West Orange, NJ</li>
            <li>Mennen Sports Arena, located in Morristown, NJ</li>
            <li>Skylands Ice World, loctaed in Sparta, NJ</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This site is exclusively for figure skaters looking for freestyle sessions. Public sessions will not be posted on this site.</p>
